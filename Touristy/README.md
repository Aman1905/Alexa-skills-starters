# __How to invoke the skill?__
Just say "__Launch touristy__" to invoke it.

# __What can it do?__
On invocation, it would say :
"Hello, I can show you some __places to visit in Australia__. Just ask me, places to visit in Australia".  

When you do as directed, it will suggest you places like "__Sydney, Bondi Beach, Gold Coast__". Further it will say "You can __ask me to brief you on any of these cities__". 

On selecting one of the suggestions, Alexa would __tell you more__ about that respective place.
